# Microservices Architecture with JHipster and Kafka

This repository contains a microservices architecture with Kafka support and includes docker-compose configuration for running the services locally. The tutorial for creating this example is available on [Okta Developer Blog]().

**Prerequisites:**
- [Java 8](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)


## Getting Started

To install this example, run the following commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/indiepopart/jhipster-kafka.git
cd jhipster-kafka
```

### Create an Application in Okta

Log in to your Okta Developer account (or [sign up](https://developer.okta.com/signup/) if you donâ€™t have an account).

1. From the **Applications** page, choose **Add Application**.
2. On the Create New Application page, select **Web**.


Configure the following authentication settings for the new Web App:
- Name: give a name for your application
- Login redirect URIs: http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc,http://localhost:8761/login/oauth2/code/oidc
- Logout redirect URIs:
http://localhost:8080,http://localhost:8761
- Grant Type Allowed: Authorization Code and Refresh Token

Copy the **Client ID** and **Client secret**, and find the **Org URL** at the top right corner in the Okta Dashboard.


### Run with Docker Compose

Create an `docker-compose\.env` file with the following content:

```
OIDC_CLIENT_ID={yourClientId}
OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET={yourClientSecret}
RESOURCE_ISSUER_URI={yourOrgUrl}/oauth2/default
MAIL_USERNAME{yourGmailUsername}
MAIL_PASSWORD={yourGmailPassword}
DISTRIBUTION_LIST={anotherEmailAccount}
```

Build the services docker images for blog, store and gateway with the following command:

```bash
./mvnw -ntp -Pprod verify jib:dockerBuild
```

Once all the services are built, run docker-compose:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

Login to the JHipster Registry at [**http://localhost:8761**](http://localhost:8761) with Okta user credentials and check the service's health.

Once everything is up, go to the gateway at http://localhost:8080 and login. Create store entity and then update it. The `alert` microservice should log entries when processing the received message from the `store` service.
